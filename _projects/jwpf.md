description: Founded in 1986, the John William Pope Foundation has a proud tradition of principled giving in North Carolina and beyond. The organization has awarded 8M+ (and counting) in grants and provided hundreds of people with opportunities. We worked with their team to modernize the foundationâ€™s online presence and provide a future-proof foundation for growth. Their new website showcases grants, stories, and allows future applications to apply online for funding opportunities.
